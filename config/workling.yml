# You can pass options to memcached client by nesting the key value pairs
# under 'memcache_options'.
#
# You can also use a cluster of Starlings. Simply give a comma separated
# list of server:port, server:port, server:port values to listens_on. 
#
# 
# For the amqp client, you can control the type of marshaling by setting:
# ymj: yaml or ymj: marshal.  It defaults to marshal if nothing is set.
